<h1 align="center">SOCIOPEDIA</h1> 

# Description:

This is a social media application where you can register a user with an image, log in with them, add friends, publish and like a post with comments and an image, and have a dark/light mode.



For this app, I used a full-stack MERN stack. On the front end, I used React, React Router for navigation, Formik with Yup for form validation, Redux Toolkit with persistent for state management and local storage, React Dropzone for image upload. On the backend, I used Node.js for runtime, the Express framework, Mongoose for managing MongoDB, JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication, and Multer for file upload.
